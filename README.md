# Venticord Studio
The plugin that lets you create for Venticord/Vencord! Brought to you by the creator of Venticord!
# Features
These are accessible from the Command Pallete. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open it. (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac? don't use a mac anymore)
## Create Plugin
**This is not Create Userplugin. This should be used if you're a Vencord contributor.**

This creates a plugin in the following directory:
```
path\to\Vencord\src\plugins\pluginName
```
with the index.tsx file included.

## Create Userplugin

Does the same thing as Create Plugin, but in `path\to\Vencord\src\userplugins\pluginName` instead.

## Test VTC Studio
Just tells you VTC is working well.

## Open VTC Studio
Opens a WebView for VTC Studio, that does nothing.
